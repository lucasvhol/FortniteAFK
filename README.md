## The Situation
Fortnite's Lego Mode offers substantial XP rewards (approximately 420k XP in 3 hours) but requires continuous player movement to prevent inactivity detection. This time commitment can be challenging for players with busy schedules or other responsibilities.

## The Solution
This AutoHotkey script automates player movement within Fortnite's process window to accumulate XP during inactivity. It uniquely directs keystrokes to Fortnite even when it's in the background, ensuring all actions remain game-specific. This functionality allows you to multitask without disrupting the script's performance, and the script efficiently counters Fortnite's inactivity checks.

## How It Works
The script automatically presses the `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d` keys in sequence.
- Each key is held for 1 second, creating a continuous movement pattern.
- The automation can be toggled on/off or stopped immediately using function keys.

## Key Features
- **Easy toggle**: F1 key turns the script on/off
- **Emergency stop**: F2 key immediately halts all automated actions
- **Fortnite-specific**: Works exclusively with the Fortnite client window
- **Low setup time**: Minimal configuration required

## Safety and Responsible Use
To ensure a safe and responsible experience:
- Create a custom SANDBOX mode in Lego Fortnite, and customize the settings to your liking, preferably creating a danger-free environment.
- Use this script only in your own worlds where you are the sole player to avoid negatively impacting the experiences of others.
- Position your character in a secure location before activating the script to ensure uninterrupted and safe operation.

**Important**: This script is intended to supplement your Fortnite experience, not replace active gameplay. Use it responsibly during times when you cannot play but wish to continue progressing.
